Hi, I’m Mike — a hands-on IT professional with over 20 years of experience designing, building, and supporting infrastructure across the Microsoft ecosystem.

I started my full time IT journey back in 2006 with a university placement at Princess Yachts, followed by support roles in Exeter and then a long-standing career at HM Land Registry. Over the years, I’ve worked my way from the service desk to third-line support, and eventually into infrastructure engineering and leadership roles.

I’ve always found that the best solutions often come from blog posts written by people who’ve faced the same challenges. That’s what inspired me to create Another Techie Blog — a space to share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning) in the world of Microsoft technologies, Azure, Terraform, PowerShell, and beyond.

What You’ll Find Here
Step-by-step guides based on real-world scenarios
Code samples and diagrams to make implementation easier
Lessons learned from actual deployments — the good, the bad, and the fixable
I write the kind of content I wish I’d found earlier in my career: approachable, practical, and focused on solving real problems. Whether you're just getting started or deep into your IT journey, I hope you’ll find something here that helps you move forward.

Let’s build better systems, automate smarter, and keep learning — together.
